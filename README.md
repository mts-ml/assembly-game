# Overview
This is an interactive word guessing game where the player needs to guess the secret word one letter at a time. The game includes a dynamic keyboard that users can interact with to make their guesses. The objective is to guess all the letters of the word before running out of attempts. If the player guesses the word correctly, they win, otherwise, the game ends when too many incorrect guesses are made.

The game features real-time tracking of correct and incorrect guesses, visual feedback on the guessed letters, and accessibility improvements to enhance the overall experience.
